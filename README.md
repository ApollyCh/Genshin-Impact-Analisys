# Genshin Impact Analysis
 <img src='figs/archonts.jpg'>
<h1> Project Overview </h1>
Genshin Impact is one of the most popular games of recent years. It was created by Chinese company "Hoyoverse." There are almost 40 million people playing this game at the moment. Besides, Genshin Impact takes the best mobile game award every year. This means that the developers give players who do not have the opportunity to buy a computer to play using a smartphone.

I am a huge fan of this game with a hundred hours of gaming experience. I am familiar with many of the game's mechanics, characters, nuances, etc. However, I would like to look at the game like an analyst and perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the data that is currently available. This paper is being written in the winter of 2024, when Natlan is not yet out.

<h1>Goals of the work </h1>
This analysis consists of three parts:

<li> Character Statistics. In the first part, we take a look at the basic categorical parameters and their visualization. We will find out if genders and elements affect the distribution of characters. We are also evaluating the weapons in each category. </li>
<li>Discrete features. In the second part, we are analyzing discrete data like ATK, HP, and DEF. We will explore the parameters not only by vision types, but also by individual characters.
<li> Genshin Impact revenue. In the third part, we are going to do a little analysis on the banner revenue data and try to find patterns. </li>
